Slop in front end - parts are just too small for tight tolerances - try switching to 0.2mm nozzle
Absolutely useless with PLA tires. Working on TPU tires.

** Electrical **

Vin is too high for servo but onboard nano regulator is too small for servo.
Had to use a buck converter but it is too big. Purchase a smaller buck converter.

The remote transmitter needs to be finished. Got stumped by NRF24 signal being lost while transmitting.
Need a cleaner power supply or some larger capacitors.

** Program **

Kind of frankenstein. Waiting for signal loss issues to be resolved before continuing.
